# POLAR: A Python Library for Polarization Analysis and Integration

## Overview
POLAR is a Python library designed for modeling, extracting, analyzing, and integrating polarization knowledge into machine learning tasks. It consists of three main components:

1. **POLAR:** Modeling and unsupervised extraction of domain-specific Polarization Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) from news articles.

2. **PRISM:** Multi-level polarization analysis and quantification, providing insights into polarization dynamics across entities, groups, and topics.

3. **PARALLAX:** Integration of polarization knowledge into classification tasks like misinformation detection and hate-speech identification, enhancing model accuracy in polarized contexts.

**Use Cases:**
Ideal for applications in misinformation detection, social media analysis, and political communication, POLAR enables robust, context-aware models in polarized information environments.
